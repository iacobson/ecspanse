Ecspanse is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework for Elixir.

Ecspanse is not a game engine, but a flexible foundation
for managing state and building logic offering features like:

- flexible queries with multiple filters
- dynamic bidirectional relationships
- versatile tagging capabilities
- system event subscriptions
- asynchronous system execution

The full documentation for the Ecspanse project is available on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/ecspanse).

Ecspanse draws inspiration from the API of [bevy_ecs](https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/). However, while [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/) is a comprehensive game engine, Ecspanse focuses on providing an Entity Component System (ECS) library in Elixir. The concepts described in [the unofficial cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/ecs-intro.html) also served as valuable references during development.

Please note that Ecspanse does not claim to be a Bevy equivalent in Elixir. If you're seeking a fully-featured ECS game library, please give [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) a try.

## Requirements

OTP-25.0 and above is required to use Ecspanse.

## Installation

Refer to the [Getting Started](https://hexdocs.pm/ecspanse/getting_started.html) guide for installation instructions.

## Getting Started

The step-by-step [Tutorial](https://hexdocs.pm/ecspanse/tutorial.html) guides you through building a simple game, introducing key features of the framework along the way.

## Demo Projects

### The Ecspanse Demo

This is the code used in the [Ecspanse Tutorial](https://hexdocs.pm/ecspanse/tutorial.html). You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/iacobson/ecspanse_demo).

### I've Seen Things

This multiplayer game was built with Ecspanse during the library's development. Check out its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iacobson/iveseenthings). The game is currently hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io/) and can be played [HERE](https://iveseenthings.fly.dev/).

## To Do
